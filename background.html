				<p>My name is Unik Shrestha. Im currently living in Sydney, Australia as a student. I am studying Bachelors of Information Technology at the momement. Talking about photography,
				i started liking taking pictures since my highschool. I didnt have a camera at that time so i used my smartphone and my brother's camera
				to take pictures. As I am a citizen of Nepal, i was grown up seeing the hills and mountains which led me to like taking pictures of natural landscape.
				I used to have fun editing the pictures using lightroom and other editing software. The another reason which made me more passionate into photography
				is my interest in traveling. I travel often and explore new places which makes me capture those moments in my camera.
