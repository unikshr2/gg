		<h1>EXPERIENCE</h1>
		<h2> Artiprenuership- 2018 </h2>
				<p>Artiprenuership is a workshop in which we express the current state of our surrounding through pictures. A specific group was formed to work on a project with the theme of
				pollution in which we should describe how pollution affects our daily life through the pictures. In the end, our pictures  were  showcased in an exibition
				where one of my picture was sold for $100. 
				</p>
		<h2>Photo Walk- 2018,2019 </h2>
			<p> I've been involved with a lot of photographers in a photo walk where I was able to gain new experience and knowledge from other. I have taken part in many
			such events in 2018 and 2019 where i was able to increase my photography skills. </p>
